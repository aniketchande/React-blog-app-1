Building chest support and definition is desirable for a fit look, but building this muscle is also functional. You need strong pecs for power for sports where you swing a bat, racket, or club. The chest press also helps you with any daily activities that require pushing or carrying. It can help restore muscle balance for athletes that primarily use pulling muscles, such as in wrestling, rock climbing, and swimming."

Resist the urge to pull on it or push off from it. 2. Lunges - Lunges work your thighs, butt, and abs. This move uses both legs at the same time, making it a great exercise for strong legs. 3. Plank leg lifts - Regular planks target the upper body, core, and hips. You can add leg lifts to strengthen your butt and upper legs. 4. Box jumps - You can also do box jumps on a plyometric box. This explosive workout is one of the best ways to tone your legs, butt, and core. When you land on the box, drop your hips to absorb the force. Don’t lock your knees and quads.

            About: "The best tricep exercises for men are a surefire way to help get you to the nearest gun show (figuratively speaking, of course). And while bulging triceps aren’t as visible as bulging biceps, don’t take that to mean they’re any less important. On the contrary, hardcore tricep workouts will build the necessary strength you need to keep pushing yourself in the gym. That’s because your triceps take up nearly 60 per cent of your upper arm mass, thereby providing a literal foundation for your continuing muscle growth, definition, and improvement. To put it another way: your overall upper arm strength is only as good as the strength of your triceps. Furthermore, no fitness freak would really argue with horseshoe triceps, a veritable sign of modern fortitude. If all this isn’t enough to pivot your focus toward this oft-overlooked muscle group, then you just keep on with bicep workouts and see how far it takes you. Go ahead. We dare you…  Don’t forget to warm-up those muscles before you start in on the harder exercises. If you’re a beginner, stick with machines before moving onto free weights. If you’re trying to build mass, start with multi-joint exercises and don’t be afraid to go to failure. Also, be sure to include both arm-overhead and lateral exercises in your tricep workout. If muscle definition is your goal, start with multi-joint exercises and then work your way toward targeted supersets. Move quickly and don’t be afraid to go to failure. The lateral head—which is located on the top of your tricep—is the largest of the three heads in your upper arm. If you’re focusing on this area, incorporate exercises during which your arms stay by your sides, such as an overhead grip."

Mountain climber - Start in a straight arm press-up position with one knee up between your elbows and only the back foot on the floor,” says Chamberlain. “Jump the back foot off the floor and swap it with the front foot. Focus on pulling your stomach muscles in throughout the movement to protect your spine and add more intensity. This is a great exercise for burning calories as well as developing your abs. Start with 30 seconds of mountain climbers and work towards 60 seconds.  Plank- An all-time core classic. Hold a straight line from your shoulders to your ankles while supporting yourself on your forearms and toes. The plank is great for beginners and there is minimal movement so less chance of getting it wrong,” says Chamberlain. It’s also easy to scale – start at 20-second holds and work up towards 60 seconds. Make sure you engage your core by tilting your pelvis back slightly to flatten your lower back – a curved lower back is to be avoided."

Strengthening your forearms also increases grip strength, which is related to upper body strength. A strong grip helps you carry, hold, and lift items in your everyday life and during athletic activity. Plus, you’ll have more power when you work out, which will bring more strength to your entire body. Begin with 5- to 10-pound dumbbells. Gradually increase the weight as you get stronger. Grip the dumbbells tightly throughout the movement. If you don’t have weights, you can use a can of soup or a bottle of water."

Virtually every upper-body exercise involves your shoulder muscles to some extent, so strengthening your shoulders enables you to lift heavier weights for chest and back exercises. Injury prevention: If your shoulders are weak, they're going to take a beating even if you perform chest and back exercises perfectly. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart apart. Lift a barbell or dumbbells to shoulder level and perform an overhead shoulder press by raising the barbell or dumbbells over your head. Hold the weight above your head for a few seconds before gradually lowering in a controlled motion. Training your shoulders will help you improve your posture, and not only will this help you look slimmer, but it will also improve your overall core and back strength. What's more, studies have found good posture bolsters focus, mood and confidence."

Traditionally this requires khoya or mawa – milk solids – and some does need sugar syrup.

Turning the original recipe into one suitable for vegetarians by swapping in paneer, mushrooms or lentils is very common practice. This creamy, tangy homestyle gravy is made mostly with tomatoes, cream and spices. While very similar to my Paneer Butter Masala and Paneer Makhanwala, this tasty recipe has a slightly different proportion of spices. I also believe that a traditional makhani gravy should be made without onions, which is how I make mine."

This is a restaurant-style Pakistani Chicken Karahi recipe that can be prepared quickly and easily with no finicky steps. Karahi is named after the pan in which it was originally cooked – a heavy, often cast-iron pan that’s similar to a wok, but rounder with a flatter base. Traditionally, meat would be simmered and stir-fried in this karahi in an open fire. I’ve read in multiple places that karahi originates in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly Northwest Frontier) province of Pakistan, which makes sense given the cuisine’s heavy use of meat and black pepper. Chicken karahi’s distinguishing features are its rich, tomatoey base and a fragrant finishing of green chili peppers, cilantro, and slivers of ginger."

The earliest evidence of rasagola can be found in the epic poem Dandi Ramayana which was composed by famous Odia poet Balarama Dasa in which he mentioned that Rasagola is offered to Maa Laxmi by Lord Jagannath in a ritual called Niladri Bije. In 2017, when West Bengal got its Rosogolla's Geographical indication status, the Registry office of India clarified that West Bengal was given GI status for Banglar Rosogolla and Odisha can claim it too if they cite the place of origin of their variant along with colour, texture, taste, juice content and method of manufacturing."

It has gained popularity in South India, and is also prepared in other parts of the world such as Iraqi Kurdistan.[7] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services. There are many types of biryani, whose names are often based on their region of origin. For example, Sindhi biryani developed in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan, and Hyderabadi biryani developed in the city of Hyderabad in South India. Some have taken the name of the shop that sells it, for example: Haji Biriyani, Haji Nanna Biriyani in Old Dhaka,[31] Fakhruddin Biriyani in Dhaka,[32][33] Students biryani in Karachi, Lucky biryani in Bandra, Mumbai and Baghdadi biryani in Colaba, Mumbai.[24] Biryanis are often specific to the Muslim communities where they originate; they are usually the defining dishes of those communities. Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat. In Hyderabad, it is famous as Kalyani biryani, in which buffalo or cow meat is used.[36][37] This meal was started after the Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar came to Hyderabad sometime in the 18th century. The Kalyani biryani is made with small cubes of beef, regular spices, onions and many tomatoes. It has a distinct tomato, jeera and dhania flavor.[38] In Kerala, beef biryani is well known.[39] The Bhatkali biryani is a special variant where the main ingredient is onion. Its variations include beef, goat, chicken, titar, egg, fish, crab, prawn and vegetable biryani."
